Space weather is the interaction of solar activity with the Earth’s atmosphere. It has a major impact on life and modern technology. We want to monitor space weather by understanding the magnetic field on the Sun ☀️. In DurhamQLM, we are part of the Solar Activity Monitor NETwork (SAMNET). The key idea is to make 3D maps of the Sun’s magnetic field. This is possible as different atoms populate different heights. Understanding the magnetic field allows predictions of space weather.
